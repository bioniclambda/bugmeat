The world's worst programming language <br/>

Yes I mean that, worse than other other language, C++, Python, Java, Assembly, JavaScript. Whatever you hate, this is worse. <br/>

Okay so let's get basic syntax. <br/>
Some things to note are:  <br/>

* Postfix
* All capitals

Also, instead of +, -, \*, and / it's ADD, SUB, MUL, and DIV



NADA: Do nothing
HALT: Stop program
ADD: Add latest 2 numbers
SUB: Subtract latest 2 numbers
MUL: Multiply latest 2 numbers
DIV: Divide latest two numbers
ECHO: Output latest number
PUTC: Output latest number as corresponding ASCII code
SWAP: Swap position of latest 2 items on stack
DUP: Duplicate latest number on stack
DROP: Empty stack
DUMP: Output all numbers on stack
LBL: Create a label with ID of latest number on stack at current position
CMP: Compare
JMP: Jump to label with ID latest number on stack
I'll write the rest later
