The world's cutest programming language <br/>

This language provides an unprecedented level of simplicity mixed with great design, allowing every programmer to express their creativity like no one has ever seen before.

Okay so let's get basic syntax. <br/>
Some things to note are:  <br/>

* Postfix
* All capitals

Also, math operators can use `+`, `-`, `*`, and `/` AS WELL AS `ADD`, `SUB`, `MUL`, and `DIV`

NADA: Do nothing <br/>
HALT: Stop program <br/>
ADD: Add latest 2 numbers <br/>
SUB: Subtract latest 2 numbers <br/>
MUL: Multiply latest 2 numbers <br/>
DIV: Divide latest two numbers <br/>
MOD: Get remainder of the second latest number on stack divided by the latest <br/>
ECHO: Output latest number <br/>
PUTC: Output latest number as corresponding ASCII code <br/>
SWAP: Swap position of latest 2 items on stack <br/>
DUP: Duplicate latest number on stack <br/>
DROP: Empty stack <br/>
DUMP: Output all numbers on stack <br/>
LBL: Create a label with ID of latest number on stack at current position <br/>
CMP: Compare <br/>
JMP: Jump to label with ID latest number on stack <br/>
I'll write the rest later <br/>
